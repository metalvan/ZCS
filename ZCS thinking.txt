OK think through this

A class of psrite has a set of animations

An object in that class has, at any one time, a current animation

z = new ZombieObject
  this.currentAnimation: 'stand'
  this.currentFacing 

move = function(x)
  this.currentAnimation: 'walk'
  this.facing: some function of x

So my question is that how do we update each of these properties of an object and have those update what the sprite is doing.
 
So is there a way, ok so an object needs to hold the direction that it's faing. So that HAS to be a property of the object.

Unless it holds which animation its doing... so in that case...

No that doesn't make sense. It needs to have an animation and a facing. Each sprite needs to have its own facing... but it needs to hold both of those properties but they get compiled into a single thing.
